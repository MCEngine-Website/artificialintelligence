## Description

This plugin serves as a library for AI to fetch responses from servers.

It is intended to be used only by AddOns, DLCs, and other plugins.

If the plugin version contains `SNAPSHOT`, it means that version is a test build and may contain bugs or have reduced performance.

Currently, there is no public hosting platform for the plugin's API library, so developers may need to wait for proper hosting support.

If you have any complaints, please open an issue.

If you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment. Iâ€™ll implement them if possible.
