# ðŸ’¬ Chatbot Information

This extension lets you chat with AI without using a command line.

Start by typing `/chatbot <platform> <model>` (Tab completion supported).  
After that, you can chat naturally messages are private and won't be visible to other players.

The AI will maintain context by combining the previous conversation with your new prompt. ðŸ¤–âœ¨
